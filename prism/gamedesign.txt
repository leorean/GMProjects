Gameplay:

beekeeping

* plant new beehives
* collect bees from tree-beehives
* grow flowers
* bees feed on flowers (and pollenise them, so they drop seeds when they wither)
* bees also feed on sugarwater (but it is expensive) or tree sap
* your only way to make income is to sell honey
* create honey by extracting it 
* you might have to get and upgrade certain tools and goods: 
	* imker suit (bees can't hurt you anymore)
	* honey extractor (gets the honey out of the combs)
	* bee net (can catch bees)
	* pheromones (can attach bees to a new hive)
